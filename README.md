# **Programming Projects: Huffman Coding and Traveling Salesperson Problem**

To learn C programming and deepen my understanding of algorithms, I created a few programming projects.  
These two projects are the ones I feel I learned the most from and had the most fun doing.  

Thank you for taking a look!

## **Projects**
1. **Huffman Coding**: A lossless data compression algorithm.  
   Learn more in the [Huffman Coding README](./huffman/README.md).

2. **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**: An optimization algorithm to find the shortest route through multiple cities.  
   Learn more in the [TSP README](./tsp/README.md).

## **How to Run**
If you'd like to run these projects locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/huffman-tsp.git
   cd huffman-tsp
Navigate to the desired project folder:

Huffman Coding:
bash
Copy code
cd huffman
Traveling Salesperson Problem:
bash
Copy code
cd tsp
Use the included Makefiles to compile and run the projects:

bash
Copy code
make
./<project_executable_name>
About This Repository
This repository showcases my journey into C programming and algorithm development. While the framework for these projects was provided (including function names and input/output requirements), I implemented the core logic, learned how to work with data structures, and gained a deeper understanding of algorithmic problem-solving.

Thanks again for stopping by!
