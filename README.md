# **Programming Projects: Huffman Coding and Traveling Salesperson Problem**

To enhance my C programming skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms, I developed several programming projects. Among them, these two stand out as the most enjoyable and educational. While the frameworks (function names and their input/output requirements) were provided, I implemented the core logic, explored working with data structures, and gained valuable insights into algorithmic problem-solving.

Thanks you for taking time to review my work!

## **Projects**
1. **Huffman Coding**: A lossless data compression algorithm.  
   Learn more in the [Huffman Coding README](./huffman/README.md).

2. **Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)**: An optimization algorithm to find the shortest route through multiple cities.  
   Learn more in the [TSP README](./travelingsalesman/README.md).

Thanks again for stopping by!
