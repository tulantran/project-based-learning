This is project I did to learn Huffman coding!
It consists of two compileable programs, named huff and dehuff which losslessly compress and decompress text files respectively.
I omitted test scripts for functions in this repository but I have some and they pass obviously. 
USAGE:
  With all these files in you directory in Linux you can run 'make' to compile
  then ./huff -
