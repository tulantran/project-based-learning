This is project I did to learn Huffman coding!\n
It consists of two compileable programs, named huff and dehuff which losslessly compress and decompress text files respectively./n
I omitted test scripts for functions in this repository but I have some and they pass obviously./n
USAGE:/n
  With all these files in your directory in Linux you can run 'make' to compile/n
  To compress a text file use: ./huff -i <text_file> -o <output_file>\n
  To decompress a file already compressed by huff use: ./dehuff -i <compressed_file> -o <output_file>\n
  With both programs, you may follow the call with -h to see a help message/n
